# TUT17-G2 OldPhoneDeals
OldPhoneDeals is a full-stack eCommerce web application designed for listing and reviewing second-hand mobile phones. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js, Vue.js), the platform supports both user-facing and admin-facing interfaces.

Users can browse listings, post reviews, manage their profiles, and perform secure transactions. Administrators can manage users, listings, and moderate reviews through a dedicated admin panel. The system also supports features like review visibility control, user disabling, activity logs, and exportable reports — demonstrating a complete three-tier architecture and secure access control.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to every member of our team for their unwavering commitment, cooperation, and the countless hours of hard work they have devoted over the past month. From late-night debugging sessions to early morning feature reviews, your perseverance and team spirit were the cornerstone of this project's success.

Special thanks also go to the teaching team for providing a thoughtfully designed project brief. It not only guided us through practical implementation but also challenged us to apply our knowledge in real-world development scenarios. Through this experience, we significantly enhanced our technical skills in both frontend and backend development, deepened our understanding of full-stack architecture, and cultivated a stronger sense of responsibility and craftsmanship.

This project was more than just an academic task—it was a journey of growth, problem-solving, and self-discovery. As the stars shift and change in the sky, let our pursuit of knowledge and wisdom remain ever constant.

Sidere mens eadem mutato.
